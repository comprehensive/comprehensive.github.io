If you like myself have a grip size larger than racquets available in stock, I
would like to tell you a story about my journey to having a racquet matching my hand.

My first raquet was 4 3/8" - I did not bother with grip sizing at the moment and needed just something to start off with.
It was Wilson Hyper Hammer, nice racquet. Pretty soon I discovered that the grip was too small. I did not perform any measurements, just had a feeling 
the grip slips off in my hands. To perform proper grip measurement, you can use guides like <a href="https://www.tennis-warehouse.com/learning_center/how_to/how_to_measure_your_tennis_grip_size.html">this one</a> 
suggested by Tennis warehouse.

So I started my research on how to increase the grip. 

I found silicon grip add-on sleeves available for purchase that increase grip size by 1/8" each. 
I had to apply 3 of them for the racquet to finally feel comfortable in my hand. So my actual grip size was 4 6/8" (or #6).
Bad news was because of the sleaves the balance of the racquet had changed to head-light. I also discovered I couldn't just go buy a bigger racquet - racquets 
of size 6 and larger are not available in stock.

Later I switched to another racquet - that was KFactor Six One Tour 90 of a size #5. After discussing 
it around tennis community I finally found out that custom handle molding would be the best solution.
But not every shop has a mold of a size #6. Eventually I got confirmation from <a href="https://rpnytennis.com/">RPNY Tennis</a> that they have all what's needed. 
With a kind help of my friend Trieu the racquet has been shipped to NY for molding and delivered back to Ukraine.
I was happy to confirm everything worked perfect with the updated racquet. The price was pretty high - $100 for the molding - but it is worth every cent. Since then I have molded one more racquet by RPNY just as a backup and I'm still happy with the outcome.

Good luck!
